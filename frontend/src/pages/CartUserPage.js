// Final Thoughts
// âœ… Pagination Strategy: Backend handles pagination via .skip() and .limit(), while frontend updates the page dynamically.
// âœ… Separate Pages for Liked & Cart Items:

// /liked â†’ Shows cards the user has liked.
// /cart â†’ Displays the shopping cart.
// This approach makes your Digimon card store fast, scalable, and user-friendly! Let me know if you need more details. ðŸš€

//// ADD INTO NAVBAR THE NEW CARDS, REMEMBER TO PUT THE CARDS AS COMPONENTS SO IT COULD RENDER IN ANOTHER PAGE
